            <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
              We believe in beauty forged by nature and history. We don’t alter
              the shape or color of the materials we find; we simply give them
              a new purpose. Our work is a partnership with the ocean,
              preserving its wild artistry for you to cherish. It's a commitment
              to sustainability, giving discarded materials a second life as
              beautiful, lasting treasures.

            <h2>Our Process</h2>
            <p>
              Our process is guided by the tides and the seasons. After every
              storm, we walk the remote shores of Tasmania, searching for the
              smoothest, most character-filled pieces of sea glass and pottery.
              Each fragment is carefully cleaned by hand and thoughtfully
              categorized. The finest pieces are then set in sterling silver or
              framed, a meticulous process that honors the material's unique
              form and history.
