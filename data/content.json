      "content": "Every piece from Tasmanian Treasures begins its journey in the tempestuous Southern Ocean. For over a century, waves have churned and tumbled fragments of glass and discarded pottery from a bygone era.\n\nWe walk these remote shores after every storm, searching for the smoothest, most character-filled pieces. The blue and white patterns on our pottery tiles are remnants of daily life in the early 1900s, while our sea glass tells a story of resilience, transformed from sharp refuse into ocean-polished gems. We don‚Äôt alter their shape or color‚Äîwe simply give them a new purpose, preserving their wild history for you to cherish."
